# What Active Directory

Active Directory is a centralized Windows OS directory service that connects users with the network resources they need. It helps the system administrators to organize resources belonging to which network, from access to the hosts to implementing policies. Additionally, it helps to monitor various network objects for smooth and easier operations within a network.
Active Directory Structure provides a clear picture of the network, allows the admins to centrally manage users and policies regardless of the size of the network. The Active Directory structure consists of three main components:
A Domain is a collection of objects (e.g. users, hosts) that share the same Active Directory database.
A Tree is a collection of one or more domains with a contiguous namespace.
A Forest is a collection of one or more trees that share a common schema
As a Network grows it will be so difficult for system administrators to track every object and resource of the company! which may lead to Security Issues.

# Why It Is Crucial to Secure the Active Directory

As we mentioned above, an Active directory provides a framework to control authentication and authorization in an organization, it shares resources within the network, compromising this environment will allow the attacker to access all types of information, which makes it a prime target for attackers. Security compromise of the Active Directory can lead to catastrophic levels of Data breaches and System Destruction.

# Common Active Directory Security Issues
Here are some of the most common AD security issues which reflect common enterprise issues.

## Default Security Settings
it’s indeed easiest and most convenient to start with the default settings. But it’s not the most secure, not by a long shot. Accepting the default configuration without reviewing what it actually is could be dangerous to your company’s confidential information, those default security settings are well-understood by hackers, which makes it an easy find.

## Over-Privileged Access
The additional privileges provided to the accounts can be used maliciously to escalate rights on a network. It is critical to ensure that every group's account is delegated only the rights required and nothing more. If the stolen credential has admin rights, the domain may be quickly 
compromised.

## Uncomplex Passwords for Accounts
Brute force attacks on AD services target uncomplicated passwords and easily guessable passwords are most at risk.

# Best Practice for a Better Security

## Limit the permissions of Domain Admins and other Privileged Groups
Review all the necessary permissions for every object's role in the organization. Ensure that every role has only the minimal level of access they need to perform their job roles.

## Patch All Vulnerabilities Regularly
System Administrators must Identify and patch the vulnerabilities found on Active Directory, as a best practice, Installing the latest OS will increase overall security.

## Use Real-Time Windows Auditing and Alerting
Administrators should know what is connected to the network, should always provide auditing and alerting of any access from inside or outside the organization, with lots of users and computers this can be challenging, that is where we get the need for automated tools.

#Wrapping up
The Active Directory is central to the success of any modern business, Understanding its vulnerabilities and applying best practices is so important to keep the business and prevent any potential attack vectors.
